					<h2>My Thinking and Learning Style</h2>

					<h4>5/17/2015</h4>

					<p>
					  According to <a href='http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm'>Gregoric Thinking Styles</a>, I am considered an "abstract random" learner. If you are curious what type of learning style you possess, I highly recommend taking this <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a>.<br /></p>
					 <p> As an abstract random learner, I like to learn by listening to other peoples thoughts/opinions, while having the ability to participate in the group activities. Although this is indeed quite important to me, I would say having general rules and guidelines to follow is just as equally important in my learning. During my phase-0 time at DBC and have definitely seen my competencies come to fruition.It's been a rewarding experience when I learn that I can handle tasks, and a quite depressing sensation when I have failed. But it is depressing in a good way (if that makes sense, haha). I've been able to understand how I need to mold my brain and change my learning patterns. I truly agree with the whole sentiment that in order to truly succeed, one must fail. This isn't to say that I am trying to fail certain exercises for the purpose of learning. </p>
					 <p>Over the last few weeks I have learned that you have to put your 110% into the exercise, and then fail or pass, you will always learn and take a positive experience away from it.I have met and worked with a handful of classmates in my cohort, and I really love the idea of peer programming. This helps me see where I am at in terms of the material, and really gives a sense of what I need to improve, while also helping and learning from my cohort. I know phase 0 is essentially a trial run to see of this indeed is the career switch for me, and I can tell your right now that I am so excited that I committed to switching. I feel that as my mindset grows with all the new material, so will my thinking style. We must adapt and evolve to new learning mechanisms, and I will try to keep embracing this with open arms and am excited to see what the future will bring!
