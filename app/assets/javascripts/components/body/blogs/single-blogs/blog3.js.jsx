				<h2>An Issue Of Conflict</h2>

				<h4>6/21/2015</h4>

				<p>I love my brother. He is one of the bestest of pals and together we form a mean 2-team wolfpack. However, I'd be lying to you if I told you we never clashed/butted heads. Being the elder sibling, I probably "picked" most of the fights, but the conflicts we had were on both sides. I remember this one time while we were in college together (yes we both went to UC Irvine). Gabe took my car without asking me. Had it been any other day I probably would have not thought much of it, but that day I had a quiz in organic chemistry. I had totally forgotten about it as I was preoccupied with a big organic lab project. Luckily a friend had mentioned it in passing. I usually would take the bus to school, but since I was warned of the quiz about an hour or so before my class I thought it best if I drive to campus. I learned that Gabe had took my car about 20 minutes before class, and at that point I knew I was going to be late. I ended up missing the quiz entirely, and when I got home I immediately assumed the role of big brother and chewed Gabriel out. </p>
				<p>As I think about this event now, I know that it was me in the wrong. It wasn't Gabriel's fault that I missed my quiz, but my own. I was the one who was not prepared, and my anger of missing the quiz was directed towards Gabe when in reality I should have noted it was all my fault. I was angry at him when I should have been angry at just myself for being the ill-prepared one. </p>
				<p>I realized that day that I was being very harsh and honestly quite selfish. The root of the conflict was the fact that I was not ready for my quiz, and in the end I missed it entirely. We easily made up that night. He agreed that he should have asked me to use my car, and I agreed that I was misdirecting my anger towards him.From what I remember I think I took him out for boba later, and I was actually able to retake the quiz during my professor's office hours later that week. If I could go back, I would obviously not have cursed out my brother and yelled at him. I probably would have still be annoyed/ticked off with the fact that he took my car without me knowing, but like I said before, if I had known about the quiz then it would have made very little difference had he taken it or not.</p>
				<p>Conflicts like these help me recognize how I should be acting in certain situations. Like coding, in life we learn from our mistakes and become better individuals from it. Breaking down the elements of our frustrations and problems is a great way to analyze what is really happening. This experience with Gabe helped me understand that I should break down the source of my emotions to its core prior to coming to any conclusions.I must exhibit patience when conflicts arise.</p>
